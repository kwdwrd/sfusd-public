Public analysis tools for SFUSD data.

## Directory structure

Each directory in `./data` corresponds to an SFUSD dataset. The details of the underlying datasets are described in their respective directories. In general, we flatten existing datasets, filter for SFUSD-relevant content, apply consistent feature names, and (where possible) try use common school, program, and demographic codes across datasets.

Most directories have the following subdirectories:
* `./raw` contains the raw datafiles; these are not always available on Github due to size constraints (e.g., SBAC data is over 1gb)
* `./merged` contains a Jupyter notebook for regularizing the raw data, and also the files generated by the regularization notebook
